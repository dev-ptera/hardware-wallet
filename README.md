TheBananoStand is a web-based [Banano](https://banano.cc/) wallet - manage your favorite digital meme currency with ease!

This project was created to manage funds via the highly secure [Ledger hardware wallets](https://www.ledger.com/), but has been extended to support seeds and mnemonic phrases as well.  

> Note: a ledger device is the recommended way to guarantee there will always be money in the banano stand. 

### Supported Browsers

- Chrome
- Brave
- Edge

> Note: Most Chromium-based browsers will work with this wallet.

### Ledger Usage

Do you already own a ledger device and want to use it to store your Banano?

1.  Visit https://thebananostand.com/
1.  Download the Banano Ledger app (>=1.2.6) onto your hardware wallet.  See [Ledger Live](https://www.ledger.com/ledger-live) for details.
2.  Connect your ledger device to your computer via USB.
3.  Open the Banano app on your ledger.

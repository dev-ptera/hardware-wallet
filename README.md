## About

TheBananoStand is a web-based [Banano](https://banano.cc/) wallet - manage your favorite digital meme currency with ease!

This project was created to manage funds via the highly secure [Ledger hardware wallets](https://www.ledger.com/), but has been extended to support seeds and mnemonic phrases as well.  

> Note: a ledger device is the recommended way to guarantee there will always be money in the banano stand. 

## Supported Browsers

- Chrome
- Brave
- Edge

> Note: Most Chromium-based browsers will work with this wallet.

## Ledger Usage

Do you already own a ledger device and want to use it to store your Banano?

1.  Visit https://thebananostand.com
2.  Download the Banano Ledger app (>=1.2.6) onto your hardware wallet and open it.  See [Ledger Live](https://www.ledger.com/ledger-live) for details.
3.  Connect your ledger device to your computer via USB.
4.  Click the "Load Ledger" button.

After your ledger is unlocked, you can now send or receive as you please.
